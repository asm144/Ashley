0. Edit "center" code to scale the interatomic distances to what they should
be - move the "center" code to your scripts file when ready (upload to github)
1. Make a new directory for every .xyz file
2. Use the center coordinates to rescale the interatomic distances and move
the atoms to the center of a 40x40x40 box
3. Copy the .inp file to the directory and make sure the method (Geometry
optimization, PBE, Temp=700, correct atom type and Basis Set name) is correct.
4. Copy the cp2k.sl file to the directory and make sure it works with .xyz
file and .inp file names you have written.
5. Submit the job to slurm using "sbatch cp2k.sl"
6. Check on the jobs using "squeue -M mpi | grep asm144"
