# Ashley
Project on Au/Cu
Objective is to run with DFT all the clusters generated by our collaborators that they found to be the minium energy structures for each size.
Run all structures on the new H2P system.
Make sure the ashley.inp files are ready and correct for each different type of system.
Thanks!
